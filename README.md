# Final Project

## Introduction
You will create a full-stack web application that displays visualized data that will be resourced from a RESTFul API.  The choice of RESTFul API and site topic will be agreed upon by your team.  Your application will need to welcome the end-user to the application and present information on why your team decided upon topic and data source.    At the conclusion of the project, you will present the application to peers, instructor and other school personnel.  During this presentation, you will elaborate on the mission of the site, team roles, goals,  and provide a walk through of coding conventions used to complete front and back end functionality.

## Back-end Features
For the back-end features, you will work with your team to complete a  web application that implements 4 features below . 
- **Requirement 1** - CRUD(Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) Operations utilizing a JSON file as the persistent data store that contains registered  and existing users.  The CRUD operations will only be performed on registered and existing users.   Users will be able to create, update and delete profile.  Each time an operation is performed, you will use the file system(fs) module in node to override/re-write the list of users.
- **Requirement 2** - Authentication and Authorization - You will create your own logic without the help of a third-party package.
- **Requirement 3** - Establish a RESTFul API connection from a reliable source.  Select a reliable data source that provides multiple records/tuples to visually depict in chart.
- **Requirement 4** - Unit test that check critical back-end functions.   A minimum of 2 unit test must be constructed to demonstrate your teams understanding of configuring Unit test.

## Front-end Features
For the front-end features, you will work with you team to implement the 3 features below.
- **Requirement 5** - Implement a charting library that provides visualization of data that is being resourced from requirement 3.
- **Requirement 6** - End-user manipulation of visualized data .  The end-user must be able to use an input element such as a drop-down menu or radio button to change the view of data being presented.
- **Requirement 7** - Site must be responsive and implement a color, graphic, typography and layout strategy.  HTML based/Component based frameworks are permissible, but not required.


## Technology, Tools and Process
- **Requirement 8** - Properly configured CI/CD server, that orchestrates the testing, hosting and creation of docker resources files  and packages created 
- **Requirement 9** - Production environment is configured and properly hosted via World Wide Web  A domain name is not required, but would be a nice to have if your team decided to purchase one. 
- **Requirement 10** - Distributed commit history from each team member using version control.  Branching strategy identified and used throughout the life of the project.

## Team Deliverable
Team evaluation form from each team member.

Submission of Github repository and Readme.md documentation.  Your readme file should include the mission of the site, team member roles and bio, goals of site,  code snippets of interaction with RESTFul API, tools and resources used and provide a url to your hosted site.  Your README.md file of your repository will be used during the presentation of your project.  No power-point will be needed, all details will be listed in the Readme.
